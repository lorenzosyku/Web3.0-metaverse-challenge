# Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Moralis


This is a Papafam challenge/project, that I built, in which I used react for building a chat app and Moralis to store the off-chain-data and handle the login/authentication of the user. No more usernames, emails, passwords... you just need a Metamask Wallet to sign in.
